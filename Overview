Trees
	Start with a root node.
	Root node may have children nodes. Each child node has one parent.

	Binary Trees are trees where nodes may have 2 children max. Subtrees are valid trees.

	Binary Search Trees are tress where left child is less than parent and right child is greater than parent.

Searching
	Linear Search
		Start at the first element and iterate through each element on the list until you find the element or reach the end of the list.

		Best O(1), avg & worst O(n)
	Binary Search
		Start with a sorted list. Use recursion to implement the search by cutting the list in half.

		Best O(1), avg & worst O(log(n))

	Depth-First Search (descendants first)
		Pre-Order
			Root/Node -> Left -> Right

		In-Order
			Left -> Root/Node -> Right

		Post-Order
			Left -> Right -> Rote/Node

	Breadth-First Search (siblings first) 
		Travel through the tree level-by-level (left-to-right)
